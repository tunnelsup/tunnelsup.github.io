    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most confusing things about Cisco ASA&rsquo;s is the licensing structure. While it is very nice to have a single train of OS files to deal with, it is incredibly hard to keep track of all of the licensing details regarding the ASA. Here is a handy guide that may help you wade through the piles of documentation around it.</p>

<h2>Quick Reference Guide</h2>

<p>To see what licenses are installed on the ASA review the outputs of the <code>show version</code> command. The output will look something like this:</p>

<p><code>
Inside Hosts                      : Unlimited      perpetual
Failover                          : Active/Active  perpetual
Encryption-DES                    : Enabled        perpetual
Encryption-3DES-AES               : Enabled        perpetual
Security Contexts                 : 2              perpetual
GTP/GPRS                          : Disabled       perpetual
AnyConnect Premium Peers          : 2              perpetual
AnyConnect Essentials             : Disabled       perpetual
Other VPN Peers                   : 250            perpetual
Total VPN Peers                   : 250            perpetual
Shared License                    : Disabled       perpetual
AnyConnect for Mobile             : Disabled       perpetual
AnyConnect for Cisco VPN Phone    : Disabled       perpetual
Advanced Endpoint Assessment      : Disabled       perpetual
UC Phone Proxy Sessions           : 2              perpetual
Total UC Proxy Sessions           : 2              perpetual
Botnet Traffic Filter             : Disabled       perpetual
Intercompany Media Engine         : Disabled       perpetual
IPS Module                        : Disabled       perpetual
Cluster                           : Disabled       perpetual
</code>
Now we will cover each of these items in detail.</p>

<h2>VLANs</h2>

<p>On the Cisco ASA 5505 you may see a line stating:<br>
<code>VLANs                             : 3              DMZ Restricted</code>
On the 5505 each interface is assigned a VLAN. This is stating only 3 VLANs can be created which are then eligible to be applied to an interface. The &ldquo;DMZ Restricted&rdquo; term indicates a further restriction. Two VLANs can talk to each other without issues. Suppose these are &ldquo;inside&rdquo; and &ldquo;outside&rdquo;. The 3rd VLAN we&rsquo;ll call &ldquo;DMZ&rdquo;. The DMZ interface is restricted to only be able to pass traffic to either the inside interface or outside but cannot pass traffic to both. That means it&rsquo;s &ldquo;DMZ Restricted&rdquo;. A sec plus license can be applied to remove this restriction.</p>

<h2>Inside Hosts</h2>

<p>This is &ldquo;Unlimited&rdquo; in all models except for the 5505. The 5505 comes with 10 hosts standard and can be upgraded to 50 or Unlimited number of hosts. This specifically means the ASA will only build connections for 10 hosts within the network at a time.</p>

<h2>Failover</h2>

<p>This is not to be confused with &ldquo;Clustering&rdquo;. Failover is when two firewalls (which are matching models and hardware) are paired together for redundancy. In an Active/Standby scenario, one firewall acts as the active one and accepts connections going through it. The active firewall will keep the active IP. So if the primary firewall goes down, the standby unit will kick over to active and even take over the active IP. This failover usually occurs without dropping a packet because the connection table is actually replicated between the two units.</p>

<p>An Active/Active scenario is generally used for multi context firewalls. This may be used when Primary firewall is the Active firewall for Context A, and the secondary fireall is the Active firewall for Context B. If one firewall goes down, the remaining one becomes Active for both Contexts.</p>

<h2>Encryption</h2>

<p>Encryption-DES comes standard on all firewalls.</p>

<p>Encryption-3DES-AES is a $0 cost license that enables 3DES and AES encryption methods.</p>

<h2>Security Contexts</h2>

<p>By default the ASA has 2 contexts that can be ran simultaneously. This is not supported in the 5505 and requires the Security Plus license for 5510 and 5512-X.</p>

<p>A multi context firewall is one which runs multiple separate firewalls inside a single chassis. The admin context is used to determine which interfaces are assigned to which contexts.</p>

<h2>Other VPN Peers / Total VPN Peers</h2>

<p>Included with base license. It is used for site to site IPSec tunnels using IKEv1 or IKEv2. It is also used when using remote access VPN (Legacy Cisco VPN Client) using IKEv1. IPSec remote access IKEv2 requires AnyConnect Essentials or AnyConnect Premium.</p>

<h2>AnyConnect</h2>

<p>For more information regarding AnyConnect Premium and Essentials see my blog post <a href="http://www.tunnelsup.com/tup/2012/08/08/understanding-cisco-asa-anyconnect-licensing/">Understanding AnyConnect Licensing</a>.</p>

<p>Advanced Endpoint Assessment is used to enhance the host scan. When normally a host scan can detect when a VPN user is out of compliancy and not allowed conection into the network, the Advanced Endpoint Assessment can actually suggest to the user what they&rsquo;ll need to do to fix it. Either by downloading an update or guiding them on fixing a program.</p>

<p>AnyConnect for Cisco VPN Phone is used for allowing VOIP phones that have built in VPN support to VPN into the ASA and then contact the Call Manager. Only supported on CallManager 8.0+ and IP Phone firmware 9.x.</p>

<h2>Botnet</h2>

<p>For more information on the botnet license and capability see my blog post <a href="http://www.tunnelsup.com/tup/2013/05/08/cisco-asa-botnet-license/">Understanding Botnet Licensing</a>.</p>

<h2>GTP/GPRS</h2>

<p>This is used by ISPs who have 3G traffic going through their network.</p>

<h2>Shared License</h2>

<p>The Shared SSL VPN license is a way to have a central ASA act as an AnyConnect premium peer license server and other participant ASA&rsquo;s can ask for licenses (in blocks of 50 at a time) from the shared license server. This requires both a Server license and particpant license.</p>

<h2>UC Phone Proxy</h2>

<p>This is a legacy license because CallManager 8.0+ does not support this feature any longer.</p>

<h2>Intercompany Media Engine</h2>

<p>Allows support to offload communications from PSTN to IP-based SIP trunks through the ASA. Primarily used for business to business federation between CUCM&rsquo;s. Requires version 8.3(1)+.</p>

<h2>IPS Module</h2>

<p>In ASA 5500-X series firewalls the IPS module is entirely software based and requires an additional license to enable it. Once the license is enabled for the software firewall, and additional support contract (smartnet) is required to update the IPS sensor with signatures.</p>

<h2>Cluster</h2>

<p>This feature is new to 9.0(1). It allows multiple ASA&rsquo;s to be grouped into a single logical device. Clustering will probably never be supported on the ASA 5500 series models. It currently is only available on 5580 and 5585-X models. Future plans to support all 5500-X models.</p>

<p>For further information read: <a href="http://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-26234">http://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-26234</a></p>

<h2>Security Plus License</h2>

<p>Refer to the image below to understand what the Security Plus license does. Note: it is only available for the 5505, 5510, 5512-X and 5585-X.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I tried installing WebVPN usability onto a Cisco ASA firewall. When trying to login I received the following error:<br>
<img src="http://tunnelsup.com/images/sslvpnerror.png" alt="SSL VPN Error IMG" /></p>

<blockquote><p>Clientless (browser) SSL VPN access is not allowed</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s odd. I&rsquo;m the administrator. I WANT to allow this. It&rsquo;s my goal to allow this! Also, I wish Cisco would have consistency for this type of VPN. Is it &ldquo;Clientless (browser) SSL VPN&rdquo; or &ldquo;WebVPN&rdquo; or &ldquo;SSL VPN&rdquo; or &ldquo;Clientless VPN&rdquo;? Make up your mind!</p>

<p>Perhaps the logs give us more of a clue. It said:</p>

<blockquote><p>May 22 2013 17:20:42: %ASA-4-722050: Group &lt;GP-WEBVPN> User &lt;test-user> IP &lt;198.198.198.198> Session terminated: SVC not enabled for the user</p></blockquote>

<p>This immediately became a battle with licensing. A quick show version gives me the following details:</p>

<p><code>
Licensed features for this platform:
Maximum Physical Interfaces       : Unlimited      perpetual
Maximum VLANs                     : 100            perpetual
Inside Hosts                      : Unlimited      perpetual
Failover                          : Active/Active  perpetual
Encryption-DES                    : Enabled        perpetual
Encryption-3DES-AES               : Enabled        perpetual
Security Contexts                 : 2              perpetual
GTP/GPRS                          : Disabled       perpetual
AnyConnect Premium Peers          : 50             perpetual
AnyConnect Essentials             : 250            perpetual
Other VPN Peers                   : 250            perpetual
Total VPN Peers                   : 250            perpetual
Shared License                    : Disabled       perpetual
AnyConnect for Mobile             : Enabled        perpetual
AnyConnect for Cisco VPN Phone    : Enabled        perpetual
Advanced Endpoint Assessment      : Disabled       perpetual
UC Phone Proxy Sessions           : 24             perpetual
Total UC Proxy Sessions           : 24             perpetual
Botnet Traffic Filter             : Disabled       perpetual
Intercompany Media Engine         : Disabled       perpetual
Cluster                           : Disabled       perpetual
</code></p>

<p>It appears we have AnyConnect Premium Peer license applied to this firewall. But is it in use?</p>

<p><code>
denver-5520/pri/act(config)# sh run webvpn
webvpn
 enable OUTSIDE
 anyconnect-essentials
 anyconnect image disk1:/anyconnect-win-3.0.0629-k9.pkg 1
 anyconnect enable
 tunnel-group-list enable
</code>
Doh! It appears <code>anyconnect-essentials</code> is enabled! Here&rsquo;s the reason why this is a problem.</p>

<p>Anyconnect-essentials does NOT support WebVPN. You must have Anyconnect Premium enabled to use WebVPN. It&rsquo;s confusing because the way the licensing works is that You can either have essentials on or not. If you don&rsquo;t then you have premium on. Either way you cannot have both at the same time. In order to make this WebVPN script work I had to say <code>no anyconnect-essentials</code> which enables the premium peers. This brought us from 250 possible simultaneous VPN sessions down to 50.</p>

<p>To learn more about AnyConnect license (and why anyconnect-essentials doesn&rsquo;t allow you to use WebVPN) see <a href="http://tunnelsup.com/tup/2012/08/08/understanding-cisco-asa-anyconnect-licensing">my post</a> about it.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Cisco ASA Botnet License]]></title>
    <link href="https://www.tunnelsup.com/cisco-asa-botnet-license/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-08T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.tunnelsup.com/cisco-asa-botnet-license</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Information regarding the Cisco ASA Botnet License.</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>Botnet Traffic Filter is an extra license that can be applied to a Cisco ASA firewall that provides detection and automatic blocking of known bots and botnets. The firewall grabs updates from Cisco&rsquo;s website to know which IPs to look for and block.</p>

<p>Besides stopping outside botnets from coming into the network the botnet filter is also very effective at identifying which hosts may have malicious software within the network. It will stop internal hosts from going out to a known botnet IP. It has the ability to listen for call-home or command/control behavior seen within the network.</p>

<h2>License</h2>

<p>It is time based. The SKU is something like L-ASA55xx-BOT-1YR=</p>

<p>It costs between $200-$1500 per year. I will only fully work on version 8.2.2 and up.</p>

<p>Purchase license. Apply it using the activation-key command.</p>

<p>Requires the 3DES/AES license (this license is free but does not ship with an ASA).</p>

<h2>Initial Configuration</h2>

<p>The firewall needs to communicate to update-manifests.ironport.com. This means it has to have a valid DNS lookup mechanism. To get this going do something like the following:</p>

<p><code>
dns domain-lookup INSIDE
DNS server-group DefaultDNS
name-server 10.2.2.2
</code></p>

<p>There are over 70,000 DNS names that are in the Cisco database and only 5000 IP addresses. To effectively look at each domain name, DNS snooping must be turned on. To do that issue the following commands:</p>

<p>```
class-map dynamic-filter_snoop_class
  match port udp eq domain</p>

<p>policy-map global_policy
  class dynamic-filter_snoop_class</p>

<pre><code>inspect dns preset_dns_map dynamic-filter-snoop
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Next turn on the dynamic-filters. I like to start by blocking everything that is blacklisted and whitelist the CEO&rsquo;s IP from being blocked. Do this by issuing the following commands:</p>

<p><code>
dynamic-filter updater-client enable
dynamic-filter use-database
dynamic-filter enable interface OUTSIDE
dynamic-filter drop blacklist interface OUTSIDE
dynamic-filter whitelist
address 10.1.4.4 255.255.255.255
</code></p>

<h2>Checking to see what&rsquo;s happening</h2>

<p>Verify the ASA is downloading the rules:</p>

<p><code>
show dynamic-filter updater-client
</code></p>

<br />


<p>Verify traffic is being inspected:</p>

<p><code>
show dynamic-filter statistics
</code></p>

<p>The show command above will tell you the <code>Total conns classified</code>. This number will only go up if traffic hits a whitelist blacklist or greylist. Cisco has a bugid CSCti70280 which is super confusing because it makes us think this isn&rsquo;t intended behavior.</p>

<br />


<p>View which hosts are being blocked:</p>

<p><code>
show dynamic-filter reports infected-host all
</code></p>

<br />


<p>A good test to conduct to see if your botnet is working is to look at the output of <code>show dynamic-filter data</code> and look for one of the hosts that&rsquo;s in the &ldquo;sample contents from database&rdquo;. Try to get to one of those hosts on port 80 making sure your traffic will go through this firewall. You should then see your statistics going up and if you&rsquo;re blocking blacklisted hosts then your session should be blocked.</p>

<br />
