    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The rack mount kits for a Cisco ASA 5506x (Part number ASA-5506-RACK-MNT=) are going for over $250! That&rsquo;s almost as much as the firewall itself! This is ridiculously high.</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t panic! You can get an older ASA 5505 rack mount kit and the 5506x will fit inside it. The older ASA 5505 mounts go for $60 or less and seem to be ok. Here are some pics from a recent swap I did.</p>

<p>The one problem here is that the 5506-X is longer than the 5505. This means you may have to secure it using some zip ties or something if you don&rsquo;t want it to slide around every time you put a cable in. In my case I added a few pieces of tape to keep it from moving and it worked great.</p>

    <updated>2016-09-29T15:05:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.tunnelsup.com/cisco-asa-command-to-show-listening-ports</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you wish there was a <code>netstat</code> command for a Cisco ASA? Are you looking to see what ports the ASA has open and is listening on? Try this command:</p>

<p>```
ASA5506# sh asp table socket</p>

<p>Protocol  Socket    State      Local Address        Foreign Address
SSL       0001ebf8  LISTEN     172.16.3.1:443       0.0.0.0:<em>
TCP       000216f8  LISTEN     172.16.3.1:22        0.0.0.0:</em>
TCP       370c1d68  LISTEN     99.99.99.99:22       0.0.0.0:*
TCP       3712d678  ESTAB      172.16.3.1:22        172.16.2.3:50233
```</p>

<p>This command displays all of the ports that are open and established on the ASA.</p>

<p>The <code>state</code> indicates whether the port is listening or established.</p>

<p>The <code>local address</code> says which IP it&rsquo;s listening on. In the example above, 99.99.99.99 is the outside interface and the 172.16.3.1 is the inside interface.</p>

<p>The <code>foreign address</code> will show up when someone connects to that port. In this case I was ssh&rsquo;d into the firewall coming from 172.16.2.3.</p>

<p>The output above should be a direct reflection of the <code>ssh</code>, <code>telnet</code>, and <code>http</code> commands in the ASA.</p>

    <link href="https://www.tunnelsup.com/how-to-show-and-clear-user-sessions-on-a-cisco-asa/"/>
    <updated>2016-06-18T16:36:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.tunnelsup.com/how-to-show-and-clear-user-sessions-on-a-cisco-asa</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you need to disconnect someone&rsquo;s ssh session to a Cisco ASA. This may be needed because users haven&rsquo;t logged out properly and have taken up all the sessions allowed.</p>

<h2>Check Usage Limits</h2>

<p>You can check usage limits by seeing how many sessions the ASA <em>thinks</em> are connected.</p>

<p><code>
FWL1# show resource usage resource ssh
Resource                 Current        Peak      Limit        Denied Context
SSH Server                     5           5          5           109 System
</code></p>

<p>In this case the ASA can only connect 5 years and it thinks there are 5 sessions open and therefore it cannot connect any more.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a bug that doesn&rsquo;t properly release sessions from the ASA. <a href="https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCsm68097">https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCsm68097</a></p>

<h2>Show current ssh sessions</h2>

<p>To display all ssh sessions connected run this command.</p>

<p>```
FWL1# show ssh sessions                      <br/>
SID Client IP       Version Mode Encryption Hmac     State            Username
0   10.1.1.21       2.0     IN   aes128-ctr sha1     SessionStarted   james</p>

<pre><code>                        OUT  aes128-ctr sha1     SessionStarted   james
</code></pre>

<p>2   10.1.1.22       2.0     IN   aes128-ctr sha1     SessionStarted   frank</p>

<pre><code>                        OUT  aes128-ctr sha1     SessionStarted   frank
</code></pre>

<p>3   10.1.1.20       2.0     IN   aes128-ctr sha1     SessionStarted   henry</p>

<pre><code>                        OUT  aes128-ctr sha1     SessionStarted   henry
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h2>Disconnect user</h2>

<p>If you want to disconnect user henry, find the SID and use this command:</p>

<p><code>
FWL1# ssh disconnect 3
</code></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you trying to set up a Cisco ASA 5506 for the first time and want to see a sample config to get you started? Well then here&rsquo;s a good template to get started with. A 5506 is often intended for a small office or home office. In our scenario there is no DMZ and we are connecting to a cable modem using DHCP.</p>

<p>Here is a basic template you can use to get started with quickly. These commands will work with any ASA version 8.3 and up. I would say this will work with any ASA version 7.2 and up, except the NAT command and DHCP commands would not work.

<h3>Breakdown of commands</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Set the interface configuration. In this template Gig1/1 is OUTSIDE and Gig1/2 is INSIDE. The OUTSIDE route is not only DHCP but I want it to be the default route. That&rsquo;s why the <code>setroute</code> command is there. The INSIDE interface has a static IP. Security level on the outside or untrusted network should always be higher than the inside or trusted network.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a NAT. In the template above there&rsquo;s only one PAT. This is important so all outgoing traffic can go through the firewall and get NAT&rsquo;d to the outside IP of the firewall.</p></li>
<li><p>Set any routes. In the example above we have the 192.168.56.0/24 network on the inside so we made a route for it. If there are no extra networks on the inside then we don&rsquo;t need this.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the ACLs. This is important to configure so it stops all incoming attacks to your network. The example above permits only ICMP (ping) replies and then denies everything else on the outside interface. Because a firewall is stateful, it will remember and permit any traffic originating from the inside and permit it back in. Essentially the template configuration let&rsquo;s you go out to the internet, but doesn&rsquo;t let any unwanted traffic in. I like to set the inside interface to only permit what I know exists inside my network. This is why the inside ACL permits only the inside networks.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a username and set the AAA configuration. In this case we created a johndoe username and set the <code>ssh</code> and <code>aaa</code> commands. This creates a user, configures logon settings, and permits ssh capabilities to the firewalls. You may want to lookup how to set up ssh for your ASA since you need to generate keys to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a DHCP server (Optional). If you need to dynamically give DHCP addresses to hosts connecting to the ASA you can configure DHCP on the ASA to handle this. These commands are in the template. The <code>auto_config</code> command should pull any domain info and DNS servers out of the outside interface that uses DHCP to get it&rsquo;s information. If it doesn&rsquo;t then you can manually set the DNS server using <code>dhcpd dns 4.2.2.2</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

    <updated>2016-03-29T23:21:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.tunnelsup.com/cisco-asa-tcp-randomization-issue</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may sometimes see this syslog message from a Cisco ASA:</p>

<p><code>%ASA-4-419002: Received duplicate TCP SYN from in_interface : src_address / src_port to out_interface : dest_address / dest_port with different initial sequence number.</code></p>

<p>I see this a lot on VPN firewalls where packets are dropped due to the sequence numbers not being correct in TCP.  This happens when the ASA randomizes the TCP sequence numbers and another device is also performing the same randomization of the TCP sequence numbers.</p>

<p>One way to bypass this is to disable TCP Sequence Number randomization on the ASA.  This can be done on a selective basis.  (NOTE:  You may need this as well as Option 19 permissions if you are putting BGP through the firewall).</p>

<p>Here is a sample conf to disable TCP randomization for a specific subnet:</p>

<p>```
access-list ACL-SEQUENCE-NUMBER extended permit tcp vpn-ip-pool any
access-list ACL-SEQUENCE-NUMBER extended permit tcp any vpn-ip-pool</p>

<p>class-map CM-SEQUENCE-NUMBER
  match access-list ACL-SEQUENCE-NUMBER</p>

<p>policy-map global_policy
class CM-SEQUENCE-NUMBER
  set connection random-sequence-number disable
```</p>
