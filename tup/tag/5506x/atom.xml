    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The rack mount kits for a Cisco ASA 5506x (Part number ASA-5506-RACK-MNT=) are going for over $250! That&rsquo;s almost as much as the firewall itself! This is ridiculously high.</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t panic! You can get an older ASA 5505 rack mount kit and the 5506x will fit inside it. The older ASA 5505 mounts go for $60 or less and seem to be ok. Here are some pics from a recent swap I did.</p>

<p>The one problem here is that the 5506-X is longer than the 5505. This means you may have to secure it using some zip ties or something if you don&rsquo;t want it to slide around every time you put a cable in. In my case I added a few pieces of tape to keep it from moving and it worked great.</p>
