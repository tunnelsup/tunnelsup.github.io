    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was troubleshooting a VPN tunnel on a Cisco ASA, 100% of the packets coming over the tunnel were being counted as <code>#recv errors</code>. It turns out that these errors can go up if there are anti-replay failures, corrupted packets, or other decapsulation errors. Because 100% of my packets were being counted for this I assumed it wasn&rsquo;t a corrupted packet or decapsulation error and began looking into anti-replay problems.</p>

<h3>Show the error count</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some show commands and configs.</p>

<pre><code>ASA/pri/act(config)# show crypto ipsec sa peer 93.184.216.34
peer address: 93.184.216.34
    Crypto map tag: outside_map, seq num: 10, local addr: 11.11.11.11

      access-list ACL-TKY-VPN extended permit ip host 10.10.10.11 host 192.168.60.60
      local ident (addr/mask/prot/port): (10.10.10.11/255.255.255.255/0/0)
      remote ident (addr/mask/prot/port): (192.168.60.60/255.255.255.255/0/0)
      current_peer: 93.184.216.34

      #pkts encaps: 0, #pkts encrypt: 0, #pkts digest: 0
      <span style="color: #FF9999;">#pkts decaps: 105</span>, #pkts decrypt: 0, #pkts verify: 0
      #pkts compressed: 0, #pkts decompressed: 0
      #pkts not compressed: 0, #pkts comp failed: 0, #pkts decomp failed: 0
      #pre-frag successes: 0, #pre-frag failures: 0, #fragments created: 0
      #PMTUs sent: 0, #PMTUs rcvd: 0, #decapsulated frgs needing reassembly: 0
      #send errors: 0, <span style="color: #FF9999;">#recv errors: 105</span>

      local crypto endpt.: 11.11.11.11, remote crypto endpt.: 93.184.216.34

      path mtu 1500, ipsec overhead 74, media mtu 1500
      current outbound spi: D0E9F6C9
      current inbound spi : 76F99C4C
</code></pre>


<p>The ACL for this tunnel is only one line:</p>

<p><code>
access-list ACL-TKY-VPN extended permit ip host 10.10.10.11 host 192.168.60.60
</code></p>

<h3>Enable Debugs</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s turn on the following debug and take a look:<br>
<code>debug crypto ipsec 1</code></p>

<p><code>Jan 19 2015 20:00:43: %ASA-4-402116: IPSEC: Received an ESP packet (SPI= 0x76F99C4C, sequence number= 0x2D) from 93.184.216.34 (user= 93.184.216.34) to 11.11.11.11.  The decapsulated inner packet doesn't match the negotiated policy in the SA.  The packet specifies its destination as 10.10.10.11, its source as 10.14.155.11, and its protocol as icmp.  The SA specifies its local proxy as 10.10.10.11/255.255.255.255/ip/0 and its remote_proxy as 192.168.60.60/255.255.255.255/ip/0.</code></p>

<p>This is a fantastic clue! What the debug is telling us is that when traffic comes over the tunnel it&rsquo;s expected to look like:</p>

<p>From: <code>192.168.60.60</code> To: <code>10.10.10.11</code></p>

<p>But instead it&rsquo;s looking like this:</p>

<p>From: <code>10.14.155.11</code> To: <code>10.10.10.11</code></p>

<p>This likely means that the remote side either does not have the same ACL defined on it OR it is NATing incorrectly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Virtual Private Network is a technology used by computers to securely connect two networks together across an insecure network such as the internet. It is often used to connect two offices together or for a remote worker to connect to a private office network. A VPN tunnel relies on encryption and integrity to pass data through it. When the traffic is strongly encrypted, it is unreadable by anyone who intercepts it. Data integrity simply ensures that the data that went into the tunnel is the same as the data that comes out of the tunnel.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpn1.png"></p>

<p>The internet is considered a public and insecure network. That is mainly because it is not owned by you. When your data travels over the internet it goes through a dozen or more systems. The owners of those systems and possibly the government can easily see all of the data going through it if it uses insecure protocols. Even if you connected to the WiFi of a coffee shop, that network may be listening to every packet leaving your computer and reading it. A VPN tunnel is a solution to encrypt your data so it can cross over an untrusted network without the fear of your data being read.</p>

<p>In order for a VPN to be created there must be two systems that set up the tunnel. This may be two routers or two firewalls or even two laptops or computers. The two devices are called peers and must agree on what traffic will pass over the tunnel, which encryption to use, and how to exchange their keys. Sometimes only specific traffic should go over the VPN and the rest of the traffic can go over the regular network. This would be called a split VPN. When all traffic is encrypted from one end then that is considered a full VPN.</p>

<h3>Using a Private VPN for Browsing the Web Anonymously</h3>

<p>Some people wish to use a VPN to encrypt the traffic leaving their computer or home network and mask their location. When a full VPN is created from one computer to another system all the traffic will appear to come from the remote end of the VPN when traveling over the internet. An example would be if someone from the US created a full VPN tunnel to Canada. When the person in the US surfs the internet, it will have a Canadian IP and websites will believe it is someone from Canada who is accessing their website. This allows a user to become more anonymous online. If you change the country of origin of your internet surfing, you could enable or disable yourself from accessing specific content. This is a way to get past any country rules that may block content.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpn2.png"></p>

<p>There are many sites out there that offer private VPN services. This allows a user to sign up for their service and VPN into that network. The user would have their data encrypted to the peer network and traffic that goes to the internet will appear to come from that peer network. This would prevent the coffee shop owner from seeing where you are going and provide greater anonymity of your web surfing. Here are a few VPN providers that offer such services. Each of these sites are pay services and range from $5-$12/mo.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a></h5>

<p>This website allows the user to choose which exit node to use out of their 1000+ nodes. They have won many awards and are highly recommended by their users.</p>

<h5><a href="http://torguard.net/">TorGuard</a></h5>

<p>TorGuard has different services based on what your needs are. They are very fast and have a great uptime record.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.ipvanish.com/">IP Vanish</a></h5>

<p>Another private VPN service provider that has thousands of IPs in numerous countries that is both fast and reliable.</p>

<h3>Site to Site VPN</h3>

<p>Companies that have more than one location often need to share resources between the offices. To connect the networks together in both offices so a remote office can access resources in the main office a site to site VPN is created. This would likely only encrypt traffic between the two sites but if a remote office needs to access the internet it uses its local internet connection. This website (TunnelsUp.com) has numerous articles about creating this kind of VPN and troubleshooting them when there is a problem.</p>

<p>When a site to site VPN is created the termination points are often routers or firewalls. A firewall has VPN capabilities usually by design. A router may not have VPN capabilities by default. The two sites would have to have similar configurations in order to agree to create a tunnel between each other.</p>

<h3>Remote Access VPN</h3>

<p>When a remote worker is away from the office and needs to access resources in the office network a remote access VPN is created. This is usually a VPN that is initiated from a the user&rsquo;s computer that connects to a device like a router or firewall in the main office. This allows the user to securely access files within the companies network. Technologies used to complete this may be SSL VPN or AnyConnect VPN.</p>

```</p>

<p>I see this router going through each of the MM states.</p>

<p><code>IKE_I_MM2</code> &ndash;> <code>IKE_I_MM3</code> &ndash;> <code>IKE_I_MM4</code> &ndash;> <code>IKE_I_MM5</code> &ndash;> <code>IKE_I_MM6</code> &ndash;> <code>QM_IDLE</code></p>

<p>This looks great. It&rsquo;s completing the entire Phase one key exchange process. So I know nothing is wrong with my ISAKMP settings.</p>

<p>Shortly after it becomes QM_IDLE it starts deleting SAs and says:</p>

<p><code>ISAKMP:(9577):peer does not do paranoid keepalives.</code></p>

<p>This sounds like the keepalives between both systems is mismatched but actually what solved this problem is that <strong>one side had PFS on while the other did not</strong>. When we disabled PFS on both sides the tunnel was able to establish perfectly.</p>

<p>If you had this same problem and you used a different way to resolve it, let me know in the comments below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I tried installing WebVPN usability onto a Cisco ASA firewall. When trying to login I received the following error:<br>
<img src="http://tunnelsup.com/images/sslvpnerror.png" alt="SSL VPN Error IMG" /></p>

<blockquote><p>Clientless (browser) SSL VPN access is not allowed</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s odd. I&rsquo;m the administrator. I WANT to allow this. It&rsquo;s my goal to allow this! Also, I wish Cisco would have consistency for this type of VPN. Is it &ldquo;Clientless (browser) SSL VPN&rdquo; or &ldquo;WebVPN&rdquo; or &ldquo;SSL VPN&rdquo; or &ldquo;Clientless VPN&rdquo;? Make up your mind!</p>

<p>Perhaps the logs give us more of a clue. It said:</p>

<blockquote><p>May 22 2013 17:20:42: %ASA-4-722050: Group &lt;GP-WEBVPN> User &lt;test-user> IP &lt;198.198.198.198> Session terminated: SVC not enabled for the user</p></blockquote>

<p>It appears we have AnyConnect Premium Peer license applied to this firewall. But is it in use?</p>

<p><code>
denver-5520/pri/act(config)# sh run webvpn
webvpn
 enable OUTSIDE
 anyconnect-essentials
 anyconnect image disk1:/anyconnect-win-3.0.0629-k9.pkg 1
 anyconnect enable
 tunnel-group-list enable
</code>
Doh! It appears <code>anyconnect-essentials</code> is enabled! Here&rsquo;s the reason why this is a problem.</p>

<p>Anyconnect-essentials does NOT support WebVPN. You must have Anyconnect Premium enabled to use WebVPN. It&rsquo;s confusing because the way the licensing works is that You can either have essentials on or not. If you don&rsquo;t then you have premium on. Either way you cannot have both at the same time. In order to make this WebVPN script work I had to say <code>no anyconnect-essentials</code> which enables the premium peers. This brought us from 250 possible simultaneous VPN sessions down to 50.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you are trying to troubleshoot a site to site VPN tunnel that is designed like this:
<img src="/images/asasitetosite.jpg" alt="ASA Site to site diagram - IMG" /></p>

<p>Upon doing <code>show ipsec sa peer</code> on the blue ASA you see the following:</p>

<p>```
interface: OUTSIDE
Crypto map tag: MAP-OUTSIDE, seq num: 200, local addr: 11.11.11.11
local ident (addr/mask/prot/port): (192.168.11.0/255.255.255.0/0/0)
remote ident (addr/mask/prot/port): (172.16.22.0/255.255.255.0/0/0)
current_peer: 22.22.22.22</p>

<h1>pkts encaps: 61, #pkts encrypt: 61, #pkts digest: 61</h1>

<h1>pkts decaps: 0, #pkts decrypt: 0, #pkts verify: 0</h1>

<h1>pkts compressed: 0, #pkts decompressed: 0</h1>

<h1>pkts not compressed: 61, #pkts comp failed: 0, #pkts decomp failed: 0</h1>

<h1>pre-frag successes: 0, #pre-frag failures: 0, #fragments created: 0</h1>

<h1>PMTUs sent: 0, #PMTUs rcvd: 0, #decapsulated frgs needing reassembly: 0</h1>

<h1>send errors: 0, #recv errors: 0</h1>

<p>```
The problem above shows that Phase 1 of the tunnel is successfully establishing but phase 2 has problems. Specifically the firewall is encrypting packets but not decrypting them.</p>

<p>If an ASA or router is getting encaps but not decaps, this means it is encrypting the data and sending it but has not received anything to decrypt in return.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Verify the other end has a route outside for the interesting traffic.</li>
    <li>Check that both VPN ACL's are not mismatched.</li>
    <li>Double check NAT's to make sure the traffic is not NAT'ing correctly.</li>
    <li>Is what you are trying to ping even responding back? Often what you're sending traffic to is not able to accept or is not responding to this traffic. I prefer to put a packet capture on the remote end firewall to see if the traffic is coming back into that firewall.</li>
</ul>
