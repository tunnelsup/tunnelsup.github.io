    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Eclipse is an IDE used to build Android applications. One of our developers was trying to use the CVS connection within Eclipse to push their code to a server over the VPN. However this was failing.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>Cannot connect to CVS in Eclipse when on Cisco AnyConnect VPN.</p>

<p>The developer&rsquo;s workflow was this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Logging into AnyConnect VPN</li>
<li>Going into Eclipse IDE</li>
<li>Connecting to CVS from within Eclipse IDE via the CVS plugin</li>
</ol>


<p>The CVS server wouldn&rsquo;t connect. But if the developer would try connecting to CVS via windows explorer (not within the IDE) while on the VPN is DOES work.</p>

<h2>Resolution</h2>

<p>Cisco AnyConnect isn&rsquo;t the problem. It&rsquo;s a setting within Eclipse that must be changed.</p>

<p>Try adding the following to <code>eclipse.ini</code>:</p>

<p><code>
openFile
-vmargs
-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
</code></p>

<p>Then restart Eclipse and try again.</p>

<h4>Small rant</h4>

<p>I HATE being a firewall admin when I have to troubleshoot individual applications. I worked on this for a week and was officially stumped and told the user to find another way. But then I found this on a forum and it worked for them. Cisco, get your act together with AnyConnect. Make it work! I think it&rsquo;s your fault because these problems didn&rsquo;t exist on the old legacy VPN client!</p>
