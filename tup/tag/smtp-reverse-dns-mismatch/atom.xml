    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was given a problem that our Cisco Ironport was not accepting email from outside people sending mail to inside people (backstory: this occurred right after we moved our Ironport to a different location). I looked in Ironport and spotted a lot of messages failing to be delivered. Specifically the error in Ironport was:
<code>Message 1006902 aborted: Receiving aborted</code></p>

<p>I spent a long time doing packet captures to try to troubleshoot and determined the remote end was sending a reset which made me think this is the sender&rsquo;s problem and not mine. However I was wrong.</p>

<p>The next thing I checked was the MX Record at <a href="http://mxtoolbox.com">MXToolbox.com</a> (a great site for looking up DNS records and stuff). Specifically the SMTP test showed this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/mxfail.png" alt="MX failing - IMG" /></p>

<p>Specifically I didn&rsquo;t like seeing this warning:
<strong>SMTP Reverse DNS Mismatch &mdash;&ndash; Warning &ndash; Reverse DNS does not match SMTP Banner</strong>
and
<strong>SMTP TLS &mdash;&ndash; Warning &ndash; Does not support TLS</strong></p>

<p>But what does that mean? I specifically wanted to know what two strings are being compared that resulted in a mismatch. Well in the case above the two strings it was comparing were <strong>***********************</strong> and <strong>mail3.example.com</strong>. For some reason this took me a long time to realize the ********************* was the banner&hellip; You can see it in the image above after 220.</p>

<p>Looking around on the internet it turns out that our Cisco ASA we have in front of the Ironport has <code>inspect esmtp</code> turned on (which is on by default).</p>

<p>Issue the following commands to turn off the inspect:</p>

<p><code>
policy-map global_policy
 class inspection_default
  no inspect esmtp
</code></p>

<p>Upon turning that inspect off the issue immediately cleared up and the results were this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/mxpass.png" alt="MX passing - IMG" /></p>

<p>Mail was then flowing into the Ironport properly and being delivered as expected. Looking back at the problem if I would have looked at the logs in the ASA I would have seen these syslogs:</p>

<p><code>%ASA-4-108004: ESMTP Classification: Dropped connection for ESMTP Request from outside:75.75.75.75/35314 to DMZ:10.0.25.101/25; matched Class 4: header line length gt 998</code></p>

<p><code>%ASA-4-507003: tcp flow from outside:75.75.75.75/35314 to PUBLIC_DMZ:10.0.25.101/25 terminated by inspection engine, reason - inspector disconnected, dropped packet.</code></p>
