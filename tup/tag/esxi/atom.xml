    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m not a VMWare expert so when it came time to upgrade my personal free ESXi host it took me a long time to figure it out. I didn&rsquo;t have any fancy tools or paid licenses to assist which meant it had to be done through a bootable USB drive. I had a really hard time figuring out what to do and then creating a bootable ESXi installation USB and wanted to document this for anyone else struggling.</p>

<h2>Download ESXi</h2>

<p>Even if you&rsquo;re doing an upgrade, you need to download the following:</p>

<p><strong>ESXi ISO image (Includes VMware Tools)</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/evalcenter?p=free-esxi">https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/evalcenter?p=free-esxi</a></p>

<p>This is a free download from VMWare and on the same page is where your free license key is. Save that since you&rsquo;ll need it after the upgrade. It changes with each upgrade.</p>

<h2>Format the USB drive</h2>

<p>First determine which <code>/dev/driveN</code> your USB drive is plugged in to. You can simply do an <code>ls /dev/disk*</code> before and then again after you plug in the USB drive.</p>

<p>Next, you can format the drive using <code>Disk Utility</code> application that comes with macOS. When you format it, make sure to set the file system to FAT, and if you have the option, write it to the master boot record.</p>

<h2>Create a Bootable USB</h2>

<p>For some reason this part tripped me up a lot. Using a Mac running OSX I was able to get this done using UNetbootin.</p>

<h4><a href="https://unetbootin.github.io">Download UNetbootin</a></h4>

<h4>Choose the ISO Image and USB drive</h4>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/esxi-boot1.png"></p>

<h4>Overwrite menu.c32</h4>

<p>Make sure to choose yes on this option.

<h2>Now Upgrade!</h2>

<p>Power down the ESXi host entirely, plug in a monitor and keyboard, and boot to the USB drive you just made. You&rsquo;ll have the option to install fresh or upgrade an existing ESXi installation.</p>

<p>The rest of this process is described in this video. Even though it is a video for 5.5 it is exactly the same for 6.0.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have ssh access to a VMWare ESXi server these commands can help you navigate the different networking settings on the server.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>esxcli network ip</code> command to do a number of different things include listing and editing the interfaces, routes and dns servers.</p>

<p>```
~ # esxcli network ip
Usage: esxcli network ip {cmd} [cmd options]</p>

<p>Available Namespaces:
  dns                   Operations pertaining to Domain Name Server configuration.
  interface             Operations having to do with the creation, management and deletion of VMkernel network interfaces (vmknic).
  ipsec                 Operations on Internet Protocol Security
  route                 Operations pertaining to route configuration
  connection            List active tcpip connections
  neighbor              Operations that can be performed on arp tables
```</p>

<h3>Show interface details</h3>

<p>This command is helpful for seeing if the interface is enabled and what the MAC address is.</p>

<p><code>
~ # esxcli network ip interface list
vmk0
   Name: vmk0
   MAC Address: 6c:62:6d:a3:2e:c2
   Enabled: true
   Portset: vSwitch0
   Portgroup: Management Network
   VDS Name: N/A
   VDS UUID: N/A
   VDS Port: N/A
   VDS Connection: -1
   MTU: 1500
   TSO MSS: 65535
   Port ID: 33554436
</code></p>

<p>This command will show the IP address of each interface and the subnet mask.</p>

<p>```
~ # esxcli network ip interface ipv4 get
Name  IPv4 Address    IPv4 Netmask   IPv4 Broadcast  Address Type  DHCP DNS</p>

<hr />

<p>vmk0  172.16.0.10     255.255.255.0  172.16.0.255    STATIC           false
```</p>

<p>The command below will show the physical status of the interface including if the link is up, the MAC address, and speed of the interface.</p>

<p><code>
~ # esxcfg-nics -l
Name    PCI           Driver      Link Speed     Duplex MAC Address       MTU    Description                   
vmnic0  0000:06:00.00 r8168       Up   100Mbps   Full   6c:62:6d:a3:2e:c2 1500   Realtek Realtek 8168 Gigabit Ethernet
</code></p>

<h3>Show the ARP table</h3>

<p>This command will show the neighbors directly connected to the VMWare ESXi host. In other words this is the way to see the arp table.</p>

<p>```
~ # esxcli network ip neighbor list
Neighbor                   Mac Address        Vmknic    Expiry  State</p>

<hr />

<p>172.16.0.2                 00:1f:ca:88:96:8c  vmk0    1139 sec         <br/>
fe80::6e62:6dff:fea3:2ec2  6c:62:6d:a3:2e:c2  vmk0       0 sec  Reachable
```</p>

<h3>Show the Routing Details</h3>

<p>This command will show the routing table on the ESXi server.</p>

<p>```
~ # esxcli network ip route ipv4 list
Network       Netmask        Gateway       Interface  Source</p>

<hr />

<p>default       0.0.0.0        172.16.200.2  vmk0       MANUAL
172.16.200.0  255.255.255.0  0.0.0.0       vmk0       MANUAL
```</p>

<p>This command will show just the default gateway.</p>

<p><code>
~ # esxcfg-route
VMkernel default gateway is 172.16.200.2
</code></p>

<p>To make routing changes on the command line use the <code>esxcli network ip route ipv4 add</code> command.</p>
