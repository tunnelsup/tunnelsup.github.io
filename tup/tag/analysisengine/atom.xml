    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes the analysis engine goes down on a Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) or IDS (Intrusion Detection System). In that case the analysis engine can be restarted from the service account by following these steps.</p>

<p><strong>Caution: If you restart the Analysis Engine in an IPS Module which is in a firewall which is acting as the active firewall, this will cause a firewall failover to occur.</strong></p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s wrong?</h3>

<p>To determine if the analysis engine is stopped, type <code>show version</code>.</p>

<code>``
Notice the</code>NotRunning` status? When this is not running it won&rsquo;t do inspection of the IPSM. Restarting this is important to having a working IPS.</p>

<p>If this happens to a IPS Module in a firewall it will not cause a failover to occur. However, restarting the service will.</p>

<h3>Login using a <code>service</code> account</h3>

<p>A service account is different than a admin account. With this type of account you will be able to navigate around the Linux OS.</p>

<p>```
charlotte-ipsm# show users all</p>

<pre><code>CLI ID   User      Privilege      
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>26711    cisco     administrator<br/>
         service   service
```</li>
</ul>


<p>SSH into the IPSM using the service account:</p>

<p><code>ssh service@charlotte-ipsm</code></p>

<h3>Restarting the CIDS service</h3>

<p>Once you are ssh&rsquo;d in, switch your user to root.</p>

<p><code>su</code></p>

<p>Use the same password you used to get in with your service account. Now stop the cids service.</p>

<p><code>cd /etc/init.d</code></p>

<p><code>./cids stop</code></p>

<p>The &lsquo;cids&rsquo; service is the Cisco IDS service. Once the service stopped you can confirm it has stopped by issuing the following command:</p>

<p><code>ps -ef | grep cids</code></p>

<p>You may see your own grep for &lsquo;cids&rsquo; but as long as there aren&rsquo;t more than 2 or so results it should be stopped.</p>

<p>Now restart the service.</p>

<p><code>./cids start</code></p>

<p>Exit out of the service ssh session.</p>

<h3>Verifying it&rsquo;s Working</h3>

<p>Log back in as a normal admin user again. Issue your show version again (note this may take a few minutes for the engine to start all the way up).</p>

You can also monitor for real time IPS events from the command line by watching the output from this command:</p>

<p><code>show event alert</code></p>

<p>If you are seeing alerts from this output the system is back up and running as expected. It&rsquo;s possible that no alerts are being triggered due to the nature of the traffic. In that case you can verify the system is good by doing <code>show statistics analysis-engine</code> and watching the packets processed number to make sure it is going up.</p>
