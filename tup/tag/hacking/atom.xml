<h2>PicoCTF</h2>

<p><a href="https://picoctf.com">https://picoctf.com</a></p>

<p>PicoCTF is a great place for anyone to start. It&rsquo;s a game that has many increasingly difficult challenges with a story behind it. Try to get all the way through it!</p>

<h2>OverTheWire Wargames</h2>

<p><a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/">http://overthewire.org/wargames/</a></p>

<p>This is a great set of challenges that has a wide range of problems to solve. The beginning challenge &ldquo;Bandit&rdquo; will challenge your linux CLI skills and shows you ways you can do things you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be able to in linux as that user. The &ldquo;Krypton&rdquo; challenge will show you some basic crypto and have you decode it. The &ldquo;Natas&rdquo; challenge is a series of websites that challenges you to hack them and manipulate them to gain access in ways you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to. Try all 4 of these to see where you niche is in solving challenges.</p>

<h2>SmashTheStack</h2>

<p><a href="http://smashthestack.org/">http://smashthestack.org/</a></p>

<p>Similar to some of the OverTheWire challenges, SmashTheStack lets you ssh to their system and solve the puzzles. The problem I had with this is the lack of cleanup done by admins and many files were left by previous participants which can get hairy real fast.</p>

<h2>HackThisSite</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hackthissite.org/">http://www.hackthissite.org/</a></p>

<p>Another hacking challenge site.</p>

<h2>FRA Challenges</h2>

<p><a href="http://challenge.fra.se/">http://challenge.fra.se/</a></p>

<p>This is a Swedish company&rsquo;s recruitment page. In it, are over a dozen challenges they&rsquo;ve had throughout the years. Their goal is to find people who can solve these challenges so they can hire them. These challenges are super fun to try.</p>

<p>To help you along or give you an idea of how in depth their challenges are, here&rsquo;s a walkthrough for Informationss√§kerhetsspecialist.

<h2>Ring Zero</h2>

<p><a href="https://ringzer0team.com/">https://ringzer0team.com/</a>
An online, Jeopardy style, CTF where you compete with others working on the same puzzles. This CTF doesn&rsquo;t appear to be timed and is always running.</p>

<h2>Embedded Security CTF</h2>

<p><a href="https://microcorruption.com">https://microcorruption.com</a></p>

<p>Another CTF to try that is not time based.</p>

<h2>CTF Field Guide</h2>

<p>Tons of links here to even more challenges, vms, ctfs, etc.</p>

<h2>Next steps: CTF</h2>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;re all skilled up on the various hacking skills, it&rsquo;s time to compete in an CTF. These are live challenges, often a team event, where you are given a specific challenge and time limit. Each team competes to solve the puzzles to score points.</p>

<p>CTFs usually break down into two categories: jeopardy and attack-defense. Jeopardy ones are more geared towards solving pre-defined challenges, while attack-defense puts your team up against another team where you try to get into their system while they try to get into yours.</p>

<p>This website tracks all the upcoming CTFs. Find one and compete. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll learn a ton of new stuff!</p>
